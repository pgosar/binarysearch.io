### Binarysearch.io

Binarysearch was a website to practice data structures and algorithms similar to leetcode. The
main value proposition was its competitive aspect - users could create private rooms with their
friends and race to complete problems, with features such as a global experience bar per user
and a leveling system.

### Goals
The idea is to create a clone of binarysearch that brings back the competitive/multiplayer
aspect.

- Full stack dockerized website powered by Judge0
- Automatic Testing library to generate testcases for problems of varying input types and constraints
- A large repository of problems

### Tech stack (subject to change)
To start:
- TypeScript
- NextJS on Vercel
- Judge0
- Socket.io
- Component Library (one of Chakra, Material, ShadCN etc)
- PostGres/MongoDB/etc
